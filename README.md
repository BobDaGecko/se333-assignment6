## AI Assistance Disclosure

This assignment explicitly permits and encourages the use of AI tools in specific areas, particularly in Part 4 where Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) is used to generate UI tests through natural language prompts.

**AI was used in the following areas:**

- **Part 4 (playwrightLLM package)**: AI agent via Playwright MCP to generate test cases from natural language descriptions
- **Documentation**: Improving clarity and readability of technical explanations
- **Code quality**: Refactoring variable names and code organization for better maintainability
- **Build configuration**: Validating and supplementing Maven configuration
- **CI/CD configuration**: Validating and supplementing Github Actions configuration

**Original work includes:**

- All test case design and logic for Part B (playwrightTraditional package)
- Manual Playwright test implementation and assertions
- Test execution strategy and verification approach
- Comparative analysis and reflection on traditional vs. AI-assisted testing approaches

All core testing concepts, assertions, and comparative analysis represent my own understanding and reasoning.
